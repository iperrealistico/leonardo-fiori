Radici (Roots) is a photographic project produced by Leonardo between 2020 and 2021 in the Garfagnana valley, his homeland. Rather than focusing on documenting abandoned places, this project reflects a personal journey of contemplation. Leonardo approached these sites once homes, huts, or metati as remnants of a past that now feels mysterious and at times incomprehensible. Left to the elements, these structures have become silent altars to another time, offering viewers a quiet space to reflect and silently observe what remains.
